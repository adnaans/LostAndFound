# LostAndFound
This is a project that I submitted to Winter PennApps 2017.
There are three different versions of the project, each in their own folder.
The Demoed Project folder contains the version that I kept locally and used in the demoes for the judges.
The DifferentLocationMethod folder contains the version that uses a different method to determine the location of whoever scans a QR code.
The Online folder contains the project that was launched online for testing. However, it was much buggier than the other two, so the other two versions might be the better ones to go with.
